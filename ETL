1)DFT (Data flow task) - Its a core component of ETL.It helps to move the data between source and destinatios.
source->Transformations->Destinations.
2)Connection managers- This sql extracts the data from diffrent source and loads in complete diffrent destination.It contains the physical connection string
3)Incremental Load- Incremental load is to compare the target table against source data based on ID Or Time stamp
Configure Incremental load in SSIS - a)Dgrag and drop DFT task from toolbox
b)Drag and drop OLEDB Sourceand check connection manager and select required DB from source. 
c)Check the columns mappings
d)Drag and drop lookup transformations - Lookup transformations which is used to compare source data to the
exixsting data from the refrence table and find matching ones.
e)In Lookup Transformation in General Tablb select Full Cache and OLEDB connection manager 
f)Configure the lookup connection settings  and map the columns
4)Conditional split - It is used to apply conditions and route data rows to diffrent output based on cspecefic conditions.It allows us to split the data 
in multiple destinations depending on content of data.
5)Better approch for incremental load- 1)Creating stateging table- Its global temp table
                                       2)Data flow task - Load data from source to destination
                                       3)Update the target table with data present in stageing table.
